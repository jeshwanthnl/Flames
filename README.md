Finding Flames For Given Names

# definition
Flames is an acronym which stands out for “Friends Lovers Admirers Marriage Enemies ‘Secret Lovers’ ”. This game can determine the relationship between two people with the use of their names. It is usually played among teens to find if they are compatible with their crushes😄. Well, I played some before and it was fun. Even though some websites use different meanings for the FLAMES acronym, it is good to stick to one definition. I suggest you stick to the definition above because it’s the perfect fit and also the meaning I’ve known since childhood.
